### Hello there!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m finishing up working on a text classification machine learning model!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about artificial intelligence and how to model the brain with math (and then with code!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making coffee! I am in love with my espresso machine (a modded Gaggia Classic Pro) and cannot wait to make my next cappucino! Currently perfecting my Dirty Hojicha recipe ;)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with front end development; specifically in React! I am working on a portfolio to host my projects as well as my successful ventures in latte art!
