### Hello there! <img width="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ben-toker/ben-toker/assets/117331544/dc6951a0-8c97-419a-bf8b-cab456779ea2">

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about artificial intelligence and how to model the brain with math (and then with code!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making coffee! I am in love with my espresso machine (a modded Gaggia Classic Pro) and cannot wait to make my next cappuccino! 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with front end development! I am working on a portfolio to host my projects as well as my ventures in latte art :)
- ðŸ“¨ You can reach me at btoker@oberlin.edu
