- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about artificial intelligence and how to model the brain with math (and then with code!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making coffee. I am in love with my espresso machine (a modded Gaggia Classic Pro) and can't wait to discover new drink recipes.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with front-end development! I am working on a portfolio to host my projects as well as my ventures in latte art :)
- ðŸ“¨ You can reach me at btoker@oberlin.edu
